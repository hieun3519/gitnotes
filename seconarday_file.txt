This is a the second file.

Untracked files - files not track by git
Git has tree
working -> staging index -> repository
        add               commit
git generates checksum for each commit label
checksum algorithms convert data into a simple number
same data always equals same checksum
git uses SHA-1 hash algorithm
40 character hexadecimal string (0-9, a-f)
Data integrity

HEAD Pointer - reference or point to new commit and always point to the tip
of the current branch in repository

when renaming files, git recognize as two separate files where the og name is
deleted and there is a new file. So commit the "new" file name and git rm there
old file name

atomic commit
- small commits
- only affect a single aspect
- easier to understand, to work with, and to find bugs
- improves collaboration

Ignore files
- pattern matching (regular expressions) // *?[aeiou][0-9] logs/*.txt
- negative expressions *.php
- ignore all files in a directory with a trailing slash assets/videos/
- comments // # this is a comments
- blank lines are skipped

what to Ignore
compiled source code
packages and compressed files
logs and databases
OS generated files
user-iploaded assets

globally ignore files
ignore files in all repositories
git config --gloval core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global  // .gitignore could be any name you want, git will use config files to ignore files in any repositories that the user is accessing

git rm --cached file_name // "remove the file" from git so git doesn't checksum
However you need to put the file_name in the .gitignore
