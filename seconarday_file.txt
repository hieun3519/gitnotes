Untracked files - files not track by git
Git has tree
working -> staging index -> repository
        add               commit
git generates checksum for each commit label
checksum algorithms convert data into a simple number
same data always equals same checksum
git uses SHA-1 hash algorithm
40 character hexadecimal string (0-9, a-f)
Data integrity

HEAD Pointer - reference or point to new commit and always point to the tip
of the current branch in repository

when renaming files, git recognize as two separate files where the og name is
deleted and there is a new file. So commit the "new" file name and git rm there
old file name
