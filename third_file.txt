git diff // we use diff to tell us what changes in the file
compares working directory against the staging tree

git diff --staged // compares the repository and staging
staged is alias for cached so git diff --cached is the same
file a is in the repository
file b is the working directory
+ // added line
- // removed line

seeing changes in diff command
space bar - next page
f - going backward
b - going forward
q - back to command line
-S - either wrap or trail the lines
git diff --color-words // see the changes in color

git show SHA // shows the diff

git diff oldestcommitSHA..endingcommitSHA // shows the difference between two commits, you can add --color-words at the end too
or you can use HEAD instead of endingcommitSHA

Undo changes in working directory
git checkout -- file // checkout --(current directory) files and replaces the changes
unstage a file
git reset file HEAD

Retrieve old versions
git checkout oldSHA -- file
make a new commit instead

reverting a commit
git revert SHA // pop a file with the revert commit message

remove untracked files
git clean // -i interactive walkthrough step -n dry run if you want to run it -f forces it to clean the file
