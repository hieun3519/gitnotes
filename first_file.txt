This is my first file.

git add . // add all changes in the directory
git commit -m "insert message" // commit the changes and add message -m
^ write present tense
git log // history of the commit
git help command // pull a man page of the command
--grep // globally search for regular expression
git status // show the status of the tree

git diff // we use diff to tell us what changes in the file
compares working directory against the staging tree

git diff --staged // compares the repository and staging
staged is alias for cached so git diff --cached is the same
file a is in the repository
file b is the working directory
+ // added line
- // removed line
